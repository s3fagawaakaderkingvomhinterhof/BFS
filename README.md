# BFS
Here is the Breadth First Search explained and implemented in Python. In general it is not a big deal but the are some traps you can fall 
into. The second thing is that you can customize this search a lot depending on your problem. 

General: The BFS is a search that is used for finding ways in graphs and more. The BFS searches for all neighbors of a node in the same 
level before going deeper. The FIFO concept of the queue is the reason for searching on the same level. With the BFS you can search for a 
path, for all paths, the number of edges between start and end, the parents of a node and a minimum spanning tree of the graph.

# Graph
The Graph.pdf shows the graph. It is a directed, weighted graph the only difference with the pdf file is the manes of the nodes.
s->0
v->1
w->2
t->3
