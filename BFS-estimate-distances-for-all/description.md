# BFS distances
In some cases it is useful to know how many edges are between 2 nodes. This so called distance begins normally 
with the startnode which has distance of 0. The neighbors of the start have distance + 1 and so on and so on.

Input: Is the graph as adjacency matrix.
Output: Is the list of distances, each node is represented by the index and listindex holds the number of edges between.
Sometimes the number of edges is called hops.
